The Compass Tutorial
Part 3: Locating your current position on a map
To locate your current position on a map, tap the latitude and longitude coordinates near the bottom of the Compass screen. 
First tap the latitude and longitude coordinates to display your current location on a map.
Your Maps app should then open, displaying your current location on a map. Since you are now in a different app, you will have to switch apps if you want to go back to the Compass app. 
Tapping the latitude and longitude coordinates in the Compass app brings up your current location in the Maps app.
For more information about the Maps app, please see the Maps Tutorial.
